 \fIl\fR is simply a string like \fIr\fR, not a regular expression as in
 the eponymous \fIed\fR(1) command.
 Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of `/';
-a `\e' can be used to quote the delimiter inside \fIl\fR and \fIr\fR.
+a `\e' can be used to quote the delimiter except `(', `)', `|' and `>' inside \fIl\fR and \fIr\fR.
 The character `&' in the \fIr\fR is replaced by \fIl\fR; `\e' also quotes `&'.
 If \fIl\fR is empty (``''), the \fIl\fR from a previous substitution or the
 \fIs\fR from a previous search or event number in event specification is used.
